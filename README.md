## Background
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterised by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar). This condition occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose and allows cells to use glucose for energy. There are three main types of diabetes:

1. **Type 1 Diabetes:**
   - Occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
   - People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin injections or an insulin pump to manage their blood glucose levels.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes:**
   - Results from the body's inability to use insulin properly (insulin resistance) or insufficient production of insulin.
   - Often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition.
   - Managed through lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and, in some cases, insulin therapy.
  
3. **Gestational Diabetes:**
   - Occurs during pregnancy. Resolves after childbirth.

Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.

Management of diabetes involves maintaining blood glucose levels within a target range through a combination of medication, lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and regular exercise), and regular monitoring. Regular medical check-ups are essential for early detection of complications and effective diabetes management.

As of January 2022, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the world's adult population has diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing globally and varies by region.

## Explanation of the data parameters  
#### HbA1c  
HbA1c, or hemoglobin A1c, is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) that is bound to glucose. The test is commonly used to assess long-term blood sugar control in individuals with diabetes. A higher HbA1c level indicates poorer blood sugar control and an increased risk of diabetes-related complications. The target HbA1c level varies for individuals, and healthcare providers use the results to adjust treatment plans and monitor the effectiveness of diabetes management.  
For people without diabetes: A normal HbA1c level is typically below 5.7%.  
For people with diabetes:  An HbA1c level below 7% is often recommended.  
For some people, healthcare providers may recommend higher or lower targets based on factors such as age, overall health, and the presence of other medical conditions

#### Blood Glucose  
In diabetes, blood glucose levels are elevated due to the body's inability to effectively regulate insulin, a hormone that helps cells absorb and use glucose. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1, where the body doesn't produce insulin, and Type 2, where the body doesn't use insulin properly. Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to various health complications. Regular monitoring, lifestyle changes, and medications are common approaches to manage blood glucose levels in diabetes and prevent associated complications. Individualised targets for blood glucose levels are set in consultation with healthcare providers based on factors such as age, overall health, and the type of diabetes.  

In Australia, when individuals with diabetes monitor their blood glucose using a glucose meter, the results are typically displayed in mmol/L.  
In the United States, blood glucose levels are commonly measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).  

#### BMI  

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical measurement that assesses an individual's body weight in relation to their height. It is a commonly used tool to categorize individuals into different weight status categories.  
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres.  
The formula is:  

BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m<sup>2</sup>)  

The World Health Organization (WHO) provides the following BMI categories:  
Underweight: BMI less than 18.5  
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9  
Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9  
Obesity (Class I): BMI 30 to 34.9  
Obesity (Class II): BMI 35 to 39.9  
Obesity (Class III): BMI 40 or greater  

While BMI is a convenient screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat or account for variations in muscle mass, distribution of fat, and other factors.  
It is important to interpret BMI results alongside other health assessments for a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's health status.
