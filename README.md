## Background
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar). This condition occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar and allows cells to use glucose for energy. There are two main types of diabetes:

1. **Type 1 Diabetes:**
   - Occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
   - People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin injections or an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes:**
   - Results from the body's inability to use insulin properly (insulin resistance) or insufficient production of insulin.
   - Often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition.
   - Managed through lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and, in some cases, insulin therapy.

Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.

Management of diabetes involves maintaining blood sugar levels within a target range through a combination of medication, lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and regular exercise), and regular monitoring. Regular medical check-ups are essential for early detection of complications and effective diabetes management.

As of January 2022, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the world's adult population has diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing globally and varies by region.

## Explanation of the data parameters

HbA1c, or hemoglobin A1c, is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) that is bound to glucose. The test is commonly used to assess long-term blood sugar control in individuals with diabetes. A higher HbA1c level indicates poorer blood sugar control and an increased risk of diabetes-related complications. The target HbA1c level varies for individuals, and healthcare providers use the results to adjust treatment plans and monitor the effectiveness of diabetes management
