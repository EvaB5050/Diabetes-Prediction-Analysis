## Background
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar). This condition occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar and allows cells to use glucose for energy. There are two main types of diabetes:

1. **Type 1 Diabetes:**
   - Occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
   - People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin injections or an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes:**
   - Results from the body's inability to use insulin properly (insulin resistance) or insufficient production of insulin.
   - Often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition.
   - Managed through lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and, in some cases, insulin therapy.

Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.

Management of diabetes involves maintaining blood sugar levels within a target range through a combination of medication, lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and regular exercise), and regular monitoring. Regular medical check-ups are essential for early detection of complications and effective diabetes management.
